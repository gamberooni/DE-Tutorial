# Project: Data Warehouse
## Introduction
A music streaming startup, Sparkify, has grown their user base and song database and want to move their processes and data onto the cloud. 
Their data resides in S3, in a directory of JSON logs on user activity on the app, as well as a directory with JSON metadata on the songs in their app.

Task is to build an ETL Pipeline that extracts their data from S3, staging it in Redshift and then transforming data into a set of Dimensional and Fact Tables for their Analytics Team to continue finding Insights to what songs their users are listening to.
